              Stuck in a small Appalachian town, a young woman's only escape
              from the daily grind is playing advanced video games. She is such
              a good player that a company sends her a new video game system to
              test...but it has a surprise in store. It unlocks all of her
              dreams of finding a purpose, romance, and glamour in what seems
              like a game...but it also puts her and her family in real danger.

            <div>It's losing me with each episode honestly.It started strong and I was really intrigued to see where things were going to venture to, but the last few episodes it just feels like the series has got itself stuck in a "limbo" where nothing is really happening and events keep repeating themselves; it's a real drag.If it is building toward something I hope it gets there fast because I'm about ready to drop this series. I like a slow-burner so long as the story is actually going somewhere, but The Peripheral just feels like it's out of ideas already.If it carries on with the constant "intense conversations" and attempted murders whilst the storyline remains in its seemingly never-ending stagnant position, then I give up.
